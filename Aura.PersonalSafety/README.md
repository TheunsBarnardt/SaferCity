## Integration into Another Project

To integrate this project into another application, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Add a Reference and appsettings.json

Add the `Aura.PersonalSafety` project to your solution and reference it in your main project.
```json
{
  "ServiceOptions": {
    "BaseUrl": "https://staging-panic.aura.services/panic-api/v2/",
    "CustomerId": "your-customer-id",
    "ClientId": "your-client-id",
    "ClientSecret": "your-client-secret"
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Configure Services

Use the `ServiceCollectionExtensions` to configure services and inject the `ServiceOptions`:

```csharp
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
using Aura.PersonalSafety.Extensions;
using Aura.PersonalSafety.Config;

public class Startup
{
   public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
   {
        // Register your services with a dynamic configuration section name
        services.AddServices(Configuration, "ServiceOptions");

        // Add Serilog logging
        services.AddSerilogLogging(Configuration);

        // Register other services
        services.AddHttpClient<LeadService>()
                .AddHttpMessageHandler<AuthorizedHandler>()
                .ConfigurePrimaryHttpMessageHandler(b => new HttpClientHandler() { AllowAutoRedirect = false })
                .SetHandlerLifetime(TimeSpan.FromMinutes(30));
   }
}
```

### Step 3: Call a Service

Hereâ€™s an example of how to use the `PanicService`:

```csharp
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Aura.PersonalSafety.Services;
using Aura.PersonalSafety.Models.Panics;

public class ExampleUsage
{
    private readonly PanicService _panicService;

    public ExampleUsage(PanicService panicService)
    {
        _panicService = panicService;
    }

    public async Task TriggerPanicAsync()
    {
        var panicRequest = new PanicRequest
        {
            UserId = "12345",
            Location = new Location
            {
                Latitude = 37.7749,
                Longitude = -122.4194
            },
            Message = "Emergency Alert!"
        };

        PanicResponse response = await _panicService.TriggerPanicAsync(panicRequest);

        if (response.IsSuccess)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Panic triggered successfully!");
        }
        else
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Failed to trigger panic.");
        }
    }
}
```

## How `AuthorizedHandler` Works

The `AuthorizedHandler` is a custom HTTP message handler used to attach authorization headers to outgoing HTTP requests. It ensures that all requests include the necessary API key or token.

### Key Functionality

1. **Attaches Authorization Headers**: 
   - Adds an `Authorization` header to each outgoing request.

2. **Simplifies Secure Communication**:
   - Centralizes the handling of authentication headers for all HTTP clients.

### Example

The handler can be registered when configuring `HttpClient`:

```csharp
services.AddHttpClient("AuthorizedClient")
    .AddHttpMessageHandler<AuthorizedHandler>();
```

This ensures that any `HttpClient` using the `"AuthorizedClient"` configuration automatically includes the authorization header.
